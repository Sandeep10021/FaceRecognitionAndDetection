                                                          FACE RECOGNITION AND DETECTION
                                                                
To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases:
•	Face Detection and Data Gathering
•	Train the Recognizer
•	Face Recognition

The main phase of any vision framework is the picture securing stage. After the picture has been acquired, different strategies for handling can be connected to the picture to play out the wide range of vision assignments required today. Be that as it may, if the picture has not been gained palatably then the expected assignments may not be achievable, even with the guide of some type of picture improvement.

1. Face Detection and Data Gathering

The most basic task on Face Recognition is of course, "Face Detecting". Before anything, you must "capture" a face (Phase 1) in order to recognize it, when compared with a new face captured on future (Phase 3).
The most common way to detect a face (or any objects), is using the "Haar Cascade classifier"
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
Here we will work with face detection. Initially, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) to train the classifier. Then we need to extract features from it. The good news is that OpenCV comes with a trainer as well as a detector. If you want to train your own classifier for any object like car, planes etc. you can use OpenCV to create one. Its full details are given here: Cascade Classifier Training.
If you do not want to create your own classifier, OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile, etc. Those XML files can be download from haarcascades directory.
The core basis for Haar classifier object detection is the Haar-like features. These features, rather than using the intensity values of a pixel, use the change in contrast values between adjacent rectangular groups of pixels. The contrast variances between the pixel groups are used to determine relative light and dark areas. Two or three adjacent groups with a relative contrast variance form a Haar-like feature. Haar-like features, as shown in Figure 1 are used to detect an image. Haar features can easily be scaled by increasing or decreasing the size of the pixel group being examined. This allows features to be used to detect objects of various sizes.

2. Train the Recognizer

On this second phase, we must take all user data from our dataset and "trainer" the OpenCV Recognizer. This is done directly by a specific OpenCV function. The result will be a .yml file that will be saved on a "trainer/" directory.
In code The function "getImagesAndLabels (path)", will take all photos on directory: "dataset/", returning 2 arrays: "Ids" and "faces". With those arrays as input, we will "train our recognizer".

3. Face Recognition
Now, we reached the final phase of our project. Here, we will capture a fresh face on our camera and if this person had his face captured and trained before, our recognizer will make a "prediction" returning its id and an index, shown how confident the recognizer is with this match.
